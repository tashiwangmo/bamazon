# bamazon
Node.js &amp; MySQL

In this assignment, I used MySQL and Node.js to set up a store front that takes lists the inventory of the store. I created Node application called bamazonCustomer.js. Running this application displays all the items available for sale.

This image shows the items listed in a table format. Followed by prompts to find which items and how many units customers are interested to purchase. It then tallies the total and asks the customer if they want to continue shopping or if they want to quit.

If one continues to shop, then the listed table of inventory will show updated version of the inventory with the sold items subtracted from the totals.

Once one chooses to end purchasing, it ends the query.
